# GRWebDev Website
## Our public face on the web

### What is this?
For the moment, this is a placeholder website which we intend to host on GitHub pages.

### Why is this a public repo?
We're waiting for our GitHub for Nonprofits application to be approved.  In order to use GitHub Pages, our repo needs to be public.  Once approved for GitHub Teams, we'll be able to move to a private repo and use GitHub Pages to host.
